Ranah2.0 Roadmap

0. Create new ranah2.0 database DONE

# ITERATION 2.1 #  DONE

1. Enable multiple tabs/windows option, ie obsolete one-window application DONE
2. Make Frames scrollable wherever it makes sense to DONE
3. Add price, created_on, updated_on dimensions for every food article/table DONE

## ITERATION 2.1 ##


# ITERATION 2.2 #   #DONE

4. Enable reading through all saved food articles, their nutrition table and filtering based on names and various sorting(eg. based on the creation date)
   Enable updating the rows, deleting and adding them  DONE

   Clean up code -> basically crate a dictionary for shared init option values everywhere it makes sense.  DONE
				 -> Reorganize project tree structure -> current one does not make sense anylonger  DONE

## ITERATION 2.2 ##

# ITERATION 2.3   #DONE

5. Enhance reading through the consumed food articles with:
	a) all possible combinations of day, month, year inputs DONE
	b) ranges of dates  DONE
	c) it should be a drop-down list instead of user writing in the numbers   DONE
	d) list all consumed food within the required time range together with their data   DONE
	e) end the list with a final row which represents the total sum of all listed rows  DONE
	f) enable and implement update/delete/close operation on every consumed food row  DONE
	g) add callback everywhere in the row  DONE
	h) create search/sort options frame for stored food tab just like the one present for consumed food tab   DONE
	i) search consumed food ONLY by name?	DONE
	j) search button handler must turn off colored column off, ie style it like the rest of the column headers  DONE
	k) add option on stored food table has to include datetime option as well(besides the weight option)  DONE
	l) Update and Delete operations on food operands need to refresh the state of the application, and do the re-rendering.
   	   Similar to broswer refreshing the page when an update operation is done. Otherwise clicking on deleted row is producing an error
   	   and update operation are not visible until user clicks search button again, this should be automatic behaviour.  DONE
	m) fix the sorting -> fails for timestamps key   DONE

## ITERATION 2.3 ##

# ITERATION 2.4 #
6. Enable creation of meal templates.
   a) For a start user has to be able to search and choose a set of food articles
      together with their weights and store it permanently under a unique name.

   b) Whenever user opens up the create meal template, corresponding frame needs to
      update the total number of food results and the dropdown list with ALL of the food names   DONE

   c) Works in a similar fashion to shopping cart, ie. user sees immediately which food articles are added in the list
	  Right/double-left click deletes the added food from the template
	  If there's at least one food in a template enable `add-template` button and print out the tally row
	  If there's 0 added food items in a template, disable `add-template` button and don't print out the tally row

   d) Clicking on `add-template` button spawns a new dialog center which takes one argument -> the template's name
      The templates name is stripped and checked if evaluates to True and if it is unique
	  If this conditions are satisfied, the template is permanently saved

   e) In order to save a template, DB has to be extended with the template model.
      Model consists of template's name(unique), it's content and potentialy created-on/updated-on timestamps
	  DB API is extended as needed.

## ITERATION 2.4 ##

7. User should be able to read through all stored meal templates, add one of them as consumed, update and delete them.
8. Add calories tab
9. Use messageboxes for info/warning alerts/pop-ups. DONE
10. Implement the Dependency Injection for database instance(instead of propagating it throughout the app)
11. Enhance all referenced file paths to be cross-platform.
12. Mark sorting column with a different color.  DONE
