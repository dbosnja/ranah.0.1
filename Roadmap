## ITERATION 2.2 ##

# ITERATION 2.3

5. Enhance reading through the consumed food articles with:
	a) all possible combinations of day, month, year inputs DONE
	b) ranges of dates  DONE
	c) it should be a drop-down list instead of user writing in the numbers   DONE
	d) list all consumed food within the required time range together with their data   DONE
	e) end the list with a final row which represents the total sum of all listed rows  DONE
	f) enable and implement update/delete/close operation on every consumed food row

6. Enable templates. For a start user has to be able to choose a set of food articles together with their weights and store it permanently under a unique name.
   a) There should be a tab for creating a new meal template, which should work in similar fashion to shopping cart, ie. user sees immediately which food articles
   	  are added in the list
   b) User should be able to read through all stored meal templates, add one of them as consumed, update and delete them.
7. Add calories tab
8. Use messageboxes for info/warning alerts/pop-ups. DONE
9. Implement the Dependency Injection for database instance(instead of propagating it throughout the app)
10. Enhance all referenced file paths to be cross-platform.
11. Mark sorting column with a different color.  DONE
